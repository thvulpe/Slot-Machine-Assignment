## 📖 Overview

This C project simulates a slot machine using a matrix as the game board. The main operations include rotating columns, detecting winning patterns, calculating rewards, optimizing symbol placement, and computing minimal path costs using BFS.

## 🛠️ Task Breakdown

### 🔁 Task 1 – Column Rotation

- Rotates matrix columns circularly, simulating slot machine spins.
- Efficient logic avoids unnecessary data shifting for multiple rotations.

### 🏆 Task 2 – Pattern Detection

- Identifies winning combinations: full rows, diagonals, and X-shapes.
- Bonus conditions are checked using frequency analysis.

### 💸 Task 3 – Reward Computation

- Calculates total rewards after each rotation.
- Combines results from Tasks 1 and 2 to evaluate outcomes.

### 🧠 Task 4 – Symbol Optimization

- Tests all possible replacements for individual symbols.
- Determines the configuration that maximizes the reward after spinning.

### 🔄 Task 5 – Rotation Strategy Optimization

- Simulates all pairs of column rotations to find the best reward.
- Restores the original state after each test to avoid corruption.

### 📉 Task 6 – Minimum Cost Path (Lee's Algorithm)

- Implements BFS to compute the minimal cost path from the first to last row.
- Uses a dynamic matrix to store distances and prevents unnecessary revisits.
